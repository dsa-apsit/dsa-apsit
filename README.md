# Data Science Student Association APSIT

Welcome to the Data Science Student Committee of APSIT, under the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (Data Science). Our mission is to build a strong and inclusive coding community that promotes a healthy coding culture among students. While our foundation lies in data science, analytics, and related domains, we encourage learning across all areas of computer science. Through workshops, projects, discussions, and peer collaboration, we aim to help students strengthen problem-solving skills, explore diverse technologies, and grow both academically and professionally.

## Who We Are
We are a community of students with diverse interests across computer science, brought together by a shared curiosity for building, problem-solving, and learning.

Although our foundation lies in data science and analytics, we are not limited to a single domain. Our members explore programming, systems, development, analytics, and practical applications of computer science while supporting each other through peer learning and collaboration.



## What We Stand For
We believe a strong student community is built on both learning and connection. Along with promoting a healthy coding culture, we value collaboration, creativity, and engagement beyond purely technical spaces.

Our committee stands for:
- Encouraging consistent learning and skill-building
- Creating an inclusive and approachable environment
- Balancing technical growth with social interaction
- Building a community where students feel comfortable participating

Because college life should not feel like a constant assessment.



## What We Do
We organize a mix of technical and non-technical activities to keep learning engaging and the community active, including:
- Coding workshops and guided practice sessions
- Peer-led discussions and knowledge-sharing meetups
- Project-based collaborations and team activities
- Technical talks and department-level events
- Non-technical fun events, games, and interactive activities to encourage participation and bonding

Our goal is to create a space where students learn, interact, and enjoy being part of the community.


## Learning & Practice
We actively encourage learning across multiple areas of computer science, including:
- Programming fundamentals and problem solving
- Data structures and algorithms
- Data science and analytics
- Backend and system-oriented development
- Tools, workflows, and best practices

The emphasis is on practice, experimentation, and understanding concepts deeply.
